## Student Grade Generator
This JavaScript program calculates the grade of a student based on their marks. It accepts marks as input and returns the corresponding grade.
## Speed Detector
This JavaScript program calculates the number of demerit points a driver receives based on their speed. It determines whether the driver is within the speed limit, how many demerit points they have accumulated, and whether their license is suspended based on the number of points.
## Salary Calculator
This JavaScript program calculates the salary deductions for PAYE, NHIF, and NSSF based on the user's basic salary and benefits. The program calculates the gross salary, then computes the relevant deductions and outputs the net salary.
